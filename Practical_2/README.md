# Practical 2
### The first program converts decimal numbers into their binary equivalents in C.
conversion.exe
```Shell
[sp52@sciprog practical02]$ gcc Conversion.c -o conversion
[sp52@sciprog practical02]$ ./conversion
The number of digits is 25
inum=33554431,  fnum=33554432.000000, inum in binary=1111111111111111111111111
```

### The second program calculates the total of a series of numbers, displays the sum, and examines the difference when the series is summed in reverse order.
```Shell
[sp52@sciprog practical02]$ ./sum
Sum1=7.485478
Sum2=7.485472
 Difference between the two is 0.000007
```
