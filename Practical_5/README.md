# Practical 5 - Fibonacci Series and Inverse Hyperbolic Tangent

## Tasks

1. **Fibonacci Series**:
   - Write a program that computes and displays the Fibonacci series up to the nth term, where the nth term is provided by the user.
   - Use a function to update the previous two terms in the sequence and loop through to generate the entire series.

2. **Inverse Hyperbolic Tangent**:
   - Implement two methods to calculate the inverse hyperbolic tangent (arctanh) of a real number:
     - One method using a Maclaurin series approximation, stopping when the element is smaller than a given precision (delta).
     - Another method using natural logarithms.
